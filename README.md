# AC Milan Squad Enhancement: Strategic Investment in Goalkeeping Talent

## Objective

The objective of the AC Milan Squad Enhancement Project is to leverage a €500 million investment to enhance AC Milan's squad, starting with the goalkeeping unit. This strategic initiative aims to boost the team's potential and competitiveness in international leagues.

## Source

The data for this project was sourced from the FIFA 23 Players Dataset, which includes comprehensive player attributes such as Overall, Potential, Market Value, and Performance Stats.

## Data Points

The dataset comprises over 1,000 potential goalkeepers from top leagues globally, with attributes including age, potential, and goalkeeper rating.

## Selection Process

The selection process involved analyzing players based on age distribution, comparing age with potential, and deciding to sell players over 30 years old. Financial analysis was conducted to ensure the feasibility of the investment.

## Criteria for New Players

Criteria for selecting new goalkeepers included:
- Best Position: Goalkeeper
- Age: Under 30
- Potential: Above 85
- Goalkeeper Rating: Above 80

## Selected Players

After analyzing potential candidates, two goalkeepers were selected. Their current wages were considered, and a predictive model was created to verify if they were not being overpaid. The predicted wages for the selected players are as follows:
- Gregor: €78,169.61
- Aaron: €60,970.84

## Model Performance

The model's performance was evaluated using the training set R² score, which yielded a score of 0.738.

## Conclusions

In this initial phase, our team's potential was evaluated following the recent changes, resulting in a one-point increase. We will proceed with subsequent phases, focusing on assessing other players and making necessary substitutions to further enhance our team's potential.
